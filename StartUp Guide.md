# StartUp Guide
If you have successfully installed Odyssey, you will have a new Mod Organizer 2 instance. Here are a few things to help you get started:

## Profiles
Odyssey currently has 3 different profiles:
- Skyrim Odyssey - this is the main profile
- Skyrim Odyssey Performance - this profile should provide extra FPS at the expense of some visual elements
- Skyrim Odyssey CS - this profile is built using community shaders instead of ENB

To changes profiles simply use the drop down menu in MO2 and select the one you want.

## Resolution
To adjust the screen resolution of the modlist you need to edit the SSE Display Tweaks ini file.

If you have a widescreen monitor (21x9 or 32x9), there are two mods disabled by default inside the Widescreen separator called Complete Widescreen Fix for Vanilla and SkyUI. You only need to enable the correct one for the size of your monitor. If you dont have a widescreen monitor leave these disabled.

## Running the Game
To run Skyrim Odyssey all you have to do is select "Odyssey" from the executable dropdown menu and select RUN.

## Alternate Start
Odyssey uses the alternate start mod called [Skyrim Unbound Reborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27962)  
When you begin a new game you will be greeted by this screen.

Here you can either:
- Press the enter key and select one of the starting presets i have made, or
- Go to the Skyrim Unbound MCM and create your own new game settings. Here you can edit your starting gear, location and lots of other things

One important detail when creating your own setting is the option to be the Dragonborn or not. If you want to do the main questline, you MUST make yourself the dragonborn.

Below that is how many days until the first dragon will appear and when you can begin the main questline.  
If you just want the Vanilla start, you have to disable the Skyrim Unbound Reborn mod inside MO2.

## Hotkeys
Odyssey is by default setup for using a controller. You can see the custom control map on the README page or the [Nexus page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/153205).  
All the keyboard and mouse hotkeys are the default keys for Vanilla Skyrim.

However, if youre using keyboard and mouse there are a few hotkeys you will want to change:
- In the TK Dodge MCM you will need to edit the hotkey to perform a dodge

- In the One Click Power Attack MCM you will need to edit the hotkey to perform a power attack

## Other MCMs
You are free to adjust any MCMs as you want, they are by default setup as my personal preference. Some of the main ones you can look at include:
- Valhalla Combat
- Violens
- Simply balanced
- RAE - Quest requirements
- Experience

## Editing the Modlist
You are free to edit the Odyssey modlist as you like, adding or removing mods. One thing i highly recommend before you do though is create a copy of the profile you are going to change. Then if something goes wrong you always have the main profile to fall back on.

Thankyou and have fun!

You MUST have a legit copy of Skyrim Special Edition on Steam.  

You must also have the Anniversary Edition with the full paid Creation Club content.  

Your Skyrim must be set to English.  

Its important you have a clean install of Skyrim Special Edition. If you are unsure you can uninstall and install again:
- Uninstall Skyrim through steam
- Make sure everything has been deleted properly, inlcusing your Skyrim steam folder and the Skyrim Special edition folder inside \Documents\My Games.
- Reinstall Skyrim on the root of a drive, e.g., C:\SteamGames\SkyrimSpecialEdition. Do NOT install inside Program Files. You can follow [this](https://github.com/LostDragonist/steam-library-setup-tool/wiki/Usage-Guide) guide to create or move your steam library if required.
- Start the game to perform the necassary checks and download the Creation Club content that comes with the Anniversary Edition.  

Change Skyrim on steam so it doesnt [automatically update](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/71AB-698D-57EB-178C#disable).
# Installation
Once you have all that ready you can follow the steps below to install the Wabbajack modlist.
## Folder Setup
For a smooth Wabbajack installation you should create 3 new folders. These can be created on the root of a drive, for example, "C:" or "E:", or in a designated games/skyrim folder you have. The 3 folders are:
- "Wabbajack" this is where you will install the Wabbajack program. If you already have wabbajack install, ignore this step
- "Odyssey" this is where the Odyssey modlist will install. This is recommended to be on your fastest drive.
- "Downloads" this is a resource where all the downloaded mods are kept. Can be on any drive, just make sure there is lots of space. Note this is optional, as Wabbajack will create a downloads location if necessary.  

Here is an example of how you could have it setup "E:\Games\Odyssey"  

You can delete the "Downloads" folder after installation to save on space.  

IMPORTANT: All these folders and your Skyrim steam folder must be located outside of Program Files
## Wabbajack Installation
Once you have completed pre-installation, download the latest version of [Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org/) and place it in the "Wabbajack" folder you created earlier. Do not place it in program files, on your desktop or in your downloads folder.  

Download and extract the Main File from the [Odyssey Nexus page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/153205).  

Then:
- Open Wabbajack
- Navigate to the Browse Lists tab
- In the top right hand corner click 'Install From Disk'
- Navigate to the Odyssey Wabbajack file and press open
- Set the Installation location to the "Odyssey" folder from the earlier steps or somewhere else you want it to be
- Set the Downloads location to the "Downloads" folder from the earlier steps or somewhere else you want it to be
- Click the install button
- Wait for the modlist to install
- Enjoy!

You need to download the latest x64 version beneath "Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2022" for [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Packages](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170).

You also need to download and install [.NET runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download).
## Nexus
You need to have/create a [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/) account. Premium is recommended to avoid having to manually click the download button for every mod.
## Skyrim
You MUST have a legit copy of Skyrim Special Edition on Steam.  
You must have the Anniversary Edition update with the paid Creation Club Content.  
Its recommended you have a fresh install of Skyrim Special Edition. If you unsure you can uninstall and install again:
- Uninstall Skyrim through steam
- Make sure everything has been deleted properly, check your steam folder.
- Reinstall Skyrim on the root of a drive, e.g., C:\SteamGames\SkyrimSpecialEdition. Do NOT install inside Program Files. You can follow [this](https://github.com/LostDragonist/steam-library-setup-tool/wiki/Usage-Guide) guide to create or move your steam library if required.
- Start the game to create the necessary default files and install the Creation Club content that comes with the Anniversary Update.
# Installation
Once you have all that ready you can follow the steps below to install the Wabbajack modlist.
## Folder Setup
For a smooth Wabbajack installation you should create 3 new folders. These can be created on the root of a drive, for example, "C:" or "E:", or in a designated games/skyrim folder you have. The 3 folders are:
- "Wabbajack" this is where you will install the Wabbajack program. If you already have wabbajack install, ignore this step
- "Odyssey" this is where the Odyssey modlist will install. This is recommended to be on your fastest drive.
- "Downloads" this is a resource where all the downloaded mods are kept. Can be on any drive, just make sure there is lots of space.

Here is an example of how you could have it setup "E:\Games\Odyssey"  

IMPORTANT: All these folders and your Skyrim steam folder must be located outside of Program Files.

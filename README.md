Download and install [.NET runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download).
## Nexus
You need to have/create a [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/) account. Premium is recommended to avoid having to manually click the download button for every mod.
## Skyrim
Must have a legit copy of Skyrim Special Edition on Steam.  
Must have the Anniversary Edition update with the paid Creation Club Content.  
Its recommended you have a fresh install of Skyrim Special Edition. If you unsure you can uninstall and install again:
- Uninstall Skyrim through steam
- Make sure everything has been deleted properly, check your steam folder.
- Reinstall Skyrim through steam on the root of a drive, e.g., C:\SteamGames\SkyrimSpecialEdition. Do NOT install inside program files. You can follow [this](https://github.com/LostDragonist/steam-library-setup-tool/wiki/Usage-Guide) guide to create or move your steam library.
- Start the game to create the necessary default files and install the Creation Club content that comes with the Anniversary Update.
# Installation
Once you have all that ready you can follow the steps below to install the Wabbajack modlist.
## Folder Setup
For a smooth Wabbajack installation you should create 3 new folders. These can be created on the root of a drive, for example, "C:" or "E:", or in a designated games/skyrim folder you have. The 3 folders are:
- "Wabbajack" this is where you will install the Wabbajack program. If you already have wabbajack install, ignore this step
- "Odyssey" this is where the Odyssey modlist will install. This is recommended to be on your fastest drive.
- "Downloads" this is a resource where all the downloaded mods are kept. Can be on any drive, just make sure there is lots of space.

IMPORTANT: All these folders and your Skyrim steam folder must be located outside of program files.
